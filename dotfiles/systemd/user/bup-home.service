# Ignore all exit codes. Failures from bup-index usually indicate that some
# files has the wrong permissions, which shouldn't stop the rest of the backup.
# Failures from bup-save tend to be a file disappearing after indexing, which
# shouldn't mark the unit failed since the backup completed anyway. Neither of
# these are optimal, but bup doesn't provide any leverage over what should
# trigger a non-zero exit.
